AVG(energy) = 0.65906
AVG(valence) = 0.484443
AVG(danceability) = 0.71646

Observing the averages in calulcation of audio aura,
    Since the energy is slighly above normal so moderately energetic songs are preferred.
    Since the valence is almost centally located so almost neutrally positive songs are preferred with slight deviation towards negativity.
    Since the danceability is 3/4th of the preferences so people enjoy music that they can dance to.

    Based on above observations, some genres could be POP, ROCK and CHILL.

Only three factors may not be quite sufficient in calculation of the audio aura because not everyone
chose and listen music based only on these three factors.
I believe speechiness is also quite important as some may prefer clear audible music where some prefer mumble raps,etc.
Similarly, the loudness is also to be considered as soft and loud music may be equally preferrable to people.
