Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: TODO
As the number of simulations increased, the prediction was consistent with Belgium as the winner but
the prediction with (N=10) showed Brazil to be the winner with Belgium following after.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: TODO
It seems like the predictions stabilized at around 100 to 1000 simulations so maybe the mean i.e 500
simulations could be called well enough.
