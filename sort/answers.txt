sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?: Because it took more time for worst and average case and less time for best case
i.e O(N^2) and omega(N).

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: Because it took the lowest time among the other two sorting algorithms
i.e theta(NlogN).

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: Because the time complexity or the time it took for each of best case,
worst case and average case was the same that is theta(N^2).
